# Research Space
This is a research directory separate from the main lib as this is a more experimental and prototype space (but may be similarly valuable).

Here we collect **jupyter notebooks**, higher level research that may not be ready or fit in `finmlkit` where the fundamental algorithms are implemented.

Here we can build and collect useful, self-contained research notebooks that can be used to explore and understand the data, algorithms, and models. 

For example, a notebook requires a financial series (in a defined form) and after running the notebook, it should output a model that can be used to predict the series, or it can visualize statistical properties of the series as a result.

The only criterion is that the notebook should be self-contained and well organized. It should have and present a clear goal (e.g. this notebook visualizes statistical properties of input series)  It should be able to run on its own and provide **clear instructions on how to run it**, what are the parameters, and the **required format of the input data**.
